# Retail Sales SQL Analysis 📊

This project provides a comprehensive set of SQL queries for analyzing a retail sales dataset using PostgreSQL. It demonstrates the use of key SQL operations including filtering, aggregation, grouping, joins, subqueries, views, and index optimization.

## 🗂️ Dataset

The dataset contains retail transaction details such as:

- Customer ID
- Gender
- Age
- Product Category
- Total Amount

## 🧠 SQL Concepts Covered

- `SELECT` — Basic and conditional data retrieval  
- `WHERE` — Filter rows based on conditions  
- `ORDER BY` — Sort data by numerical or categorical columns  
- `GROUP BY` with `COUNT` and `SUM` — Aggregation  
- `JOIN` — Combine data from multiple tables  
- `Subqueries` — Nested queries for advanced filtering  
- `Views` — Virtual tables for reusable logic  
- `CREATE INDEX` — Performance tuning
